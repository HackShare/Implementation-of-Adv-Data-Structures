CS 6301.{013,016}: Implementation of advanced DS&A
Project 5 (Type 1: Arithmetic with large numbers).

This project is optional.  It is eligible for excellence award.
Only projects submitted by 1st deadline are eligible for exc award.

Ver 0.1: Sat, Sep 20
More details will be added by Mon, Sep 22. 
Additional operations may be added until version becomes 1.0.
Ver 1.0: No changes.
Ver 1.1: 10/8: Added line numbers to sample input.
Ver 1.2: 10/10: Removed last line from sample input (undefined var).

Deadlines: 2 AM on Monday: Oct 13 (1st), Oct 20 (2nd), Oct 27 (3rd).

Rules: Same rules as Project 4.

Extend Project 4 to handle the following additional operations.
You can change the implementation by allowing each node of the
linked list to store up to 100 integers.  All operations defined
in project 4 should be implemented.  In addition:

1. Handle negative numbers.
2. Division operation: / (integer division).
3. Remainder: % (mod)
4. Square root: ~ (integer part).  Ex: 27~ is 5.
5. Max power in 15 secs: ).  Find the maximum power of a number that the
   program can calculate in 15 secs, using repeated squaring.

Sample input:
1 a=4
2 b=11
3 c=a-b
4 d=b/a
5 e=b%a
6 f=b~
7 g=a)
8 c
9 d
10 e
11 f
12 g

Comments after # are not part of the output.  Its output:
-7	# 4-11
2	# 11/4 - integer division
3	# 11%4 - remainder when 11 is divided by 4
3	# sqrt(11)
?	# g gets the maximum power of a=4, found in 15 secs, by squaring.
        # i.e., 4, 4^2, 16^2, 256^2, etc. in 15 secs.
