Project 2 (Type 1: Enumeration of permutations and combinations)

Ver 1.0: Thu, Sep 4

Deadlines: 2 AM on Monday: Sep 15 (1st), Sep 22 (2nd), Sep 29 (3rd).

Rules: Do not use code from others for this project.  You are free
to use any source of information, printed or online, except for ones that
have the code for solving these problems.  Any pseudocode or code given
in class may be used as a starting point for your code, and it will not be
considered as plagiarism.

For each of the following problems, write a function "visit," with code
similar to the following.  It visits a permutation/combination, and prints
it, if the parameter "verbose" is nonzero.  Modify the code as needed.

int visit(A, n, verbose, count)
{
   if (verbose &gt; 0) {
      for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
	 if (A[i] &gt; 0) System.out.print(A[i] + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
   }
   return count+1;
}

Problems
--------
1. Write a program that visits all permutations/combinations of k objects
   from a set of n distinct objects, numbered 1..n.  The program takes
   input from the console/terminal/stdin and prints output to stdout.

   Input specification:
   Each line of input has 3 integers: n, k, and v.
   n is between 3 and 1000;  k is an integer between 0 and n; v is in {0,1,2,3}.

   Output specification:
   if v = 0, the program outputs one line with 2 integers: the number of
   permutations of k objects out of n distinct objects, and the time taken
   by the program in milliseconds (rounded to integer).  Even though the
   program is not printing the permutations, it should visit all permutations.

   if v = 1, the program again outputs one line with 2 integers, like the
   above case, except it outputs the number of combinations of k out of n.

   if v = 2 (verbose output version of v=0), the program should output all
   the actual permutations, one line at a time, and then the output of v=0.

   if v = 3 (verbose output of v=1), output all the actual combinations,
   and then the output of v=1.

   Sample input:
   4 2 2

   Sample output:
   1 2
   1 3
   1 4
   2 1
   2 3
   2 4
   3 1
   3 2
   3 4
   4 1
   4 2
   4 3
   12 0
   

2. Write a program that visits all permutations of n (not necessarily
   distinct) objects.  The program reads from its standard input (stdin)
   and writes the output to stdout.

   Input specification:
   First line of input has 2 integers, n and v.
   The value of n is between 0 and 1000;  v is either 0 or 1.
   The next n integers in the input (separated by spaces and/or newlines)
   are the n elements.

   Output specification:
   If v &gt; 0, then print each distinct permutation in one line of output.
   If v = 0, only one line of output is generated (below).  But your
   program should visit all the permutations, though it does not output them.
   The last line of output has the number of permutations visited and the
   time taken by the program in milliseconds (rounded to an integer).

   Sample input:
   4 1
   1 2 3 2

   Sample output:
   1 2 2 3
   1 2 3 2
   1 3 2 2
   2 1 2 3
   2 1 3 2
   2 2 1 3
   2 2 3 1
   2 3 1 2
   2 3 2 1
   3 1 2 2
   3 2 1 2
   3 2 2 1
   12 0
