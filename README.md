# Implementation-of-Adv-Data-Structures
Projects on advanced algorithms in Graphs like Maximum weighted bipartite matching, Shortest path algorithms like Bellman-Ford algorithm, Djikstra algorithm, DAG, Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms like Kruskal, Prims, Hashing, Priority Queues, ecommerce website like Amazon,  Arithmetic operation on very big numbers using linked list and so on. 
All projects are developed in Java.

FILES IN THE REPOSITORY:

1) All folders and files in the repository are submitted as part of various projects in my course 'Implementation of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms'.
2) All source code starts with 'mxm135730<fileName>' and please ignore 'mxm135730' as it represents my school ID which is used for evaluation.
3) Each folder contains the 'Question' document asked by my Professor and source codes written in Java.
4) 'mxm135730DriverProgram' in each folder contains the 'main()' function to run the project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Project1 - Merge sort implemented in 3 different ways. Run 'mxm135730DriverProgram' which prints the running time of the 3 merge sort functions in milli seconds for the given input
Project2 - Permutation and Combination
Project4 and 5 - All Arithmetic Operations on very very large numbers using LinkedList
Project6 - eCommerce website implemented using Trees and Hash
Project7 - Minium Spanning Tree in Graphs
Project8PartA - MST algorithms in Graph (Prims and Kruskal algorithms)
Project9Basic - Maximum Matching in Bipartite Graphs
Project9PartA - Maximum Matching in General Graphs
Project10 - (toughest project) Christofides algorithm, Travelling Saleman Problem, Kruskal Algorithm, Minimum weight perfect matching
Sort - contains MergeSort(3 ways) and QuickSort(2 ways of implementation)
UndirectedGraph - implementation of undirected graph
